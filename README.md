# SHARP

A web application project.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Install WAMP**  
    For best compatibility, install [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/).

2. **Alternative: XAMPP or Localhost**  
    You may use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) or another local server, but you **must** set up a virtual host for proper routing.

## Steps

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SHARP.git
    ```
2. Place the project folder in your web server's root directory (e.g., `www` for WAMP, `htdocs` for XAMPP).
3. Set up a virtual host pointing to the project directory.
4. Start your local server and access the project via the configured virtual host URL.

## Notes

- Ensure PHP and MySQL are enabled in your server stack.
- Configure database settings as needed in the project files.
